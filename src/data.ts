      project: `Brain Controlled Smart Wheelchair Based on Mental Task Classification
      TWO integrative modules, BCI Wheelchair and E-Health tracking system module. Accordingly,
      in a team of five members, we have succeeded in the development of a smart wheelchair that can
      be moved using brain activity signals, Electroencephalography signals, using machine learning
      algorithms for classification, and blink detection using camera for safety measures and other
      controls. An android mobile application was developed for monitoring the patients and keeping
      track of their safety and location in real-time.`,
